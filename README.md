VoltOS Manual





might be windows only, I have no clue, I wrote this program like 3 years ago
CONFIG ONLY TO BE USED WITH ".py" FILES.



Programs:
VIRIDI
RANDNUM
CONFIG
(Only run after using CONFIG.)
EXTERNAL1
EXTERNAL2
EXTERNAL3
(The rest of these are fine.)
Note: The programming section also supports time.sleep(). (Imported module.)
Syntax: time.sleep(how many seconds to wait)





Open VoltOS.py, and VoltOS should run. For best experience, copy the path to the file, and paste it in cmd prompt.
